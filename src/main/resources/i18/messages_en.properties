The project also contains examples of unit and integration tests.

The users can do the following actions (depending on role):
help.content.22=register/log in/view profile/edit profile/log out \n\
view/create/edit/delete any user profile (ADMIN only) \n\
view Jet models \n\
create/edit/delete Jet models (ADMIN only) \n\
view/create/edit Jet orders \n\
view/create/edit/delete Jet orders for any customer (ADMIN only) \n\
view Jet factory schedule page (under construction) \n\
