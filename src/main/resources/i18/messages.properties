help.about=_About JetShop system
help.content.1=_The main purpose was to learn some Spring/Spring Boot features \
(MVC, Spring Data, Security, AOP etc.). \

In-memory database H2 is used for data storage.\n\
The project also contains examples of unit and integration tests.
help.content.21=_JetShop application allows to manage Jet orders.\n\
The users can do the following actions (depending on role):
help.content.22=_register/log in/view profile/edit profile/log out \n\
view/create/edit/delete any user profile (ADMIN only) \n\
view Jet models \n\
create/edit/delete Jet models (ADMIN only) \n\
view/create/edit Jet orders \n\
view/create/edit/delete Jet orders for any customer (ADMIN only) \n\
view Jet factory schedule page (under construction) \n\
view design page, which represents overall UI design in one page (ADMIN only) \n\
select UI language (English/Russian) \n\
